Hi everyone. In this project we will tackle one of the problems mentioned in the instructions for the assignment. 
If someone is looking to open a business in the city of Toronto, how can we recommend the best neighborhood to open his business in? 
The idea is that we want to open a business in a neighborhood where that venue type is least common to maximize profits and avoid competition. 
For this problem, we will take as an example an investor who wants to open a pizza place in the city of Toronto
