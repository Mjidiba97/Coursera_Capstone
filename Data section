  The data used for this project will be obtained from Foursquare (https://es.foursquare.com/) and from a wikepedia page containing the list of postal codes for Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M). Information on neighborhoods as well as popular venues within them will be obtained from Foursquare.
  First of all, we will extract the information from the Wikipedia page, which is a table containing 3 columns: Postcode, Borough	and Neighborhood. Then we will perform some modifications so as to have one line for each postal code. 
  Next we will search for corrdinates for each postal code in toronto and add them as two seperate columns to the table.
  Then, using Foursquare API, we will create a dataset containing all the venues in a radius of 1km to each borough. We suppose that 1km is the maximum distance that people are willing to walk to a certain business (in our case, a fast food restaurant).
  Finally, we will calculate a value for each line (borough) that describes the degree of presence of fast food chains in that area. This will be a sum of the fast food chains present in that area, multiplied by the distance from the borough center
