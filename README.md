# New Business Location Recommendation System

<b>Note</b>: This project is part of the IBM's 'Professional Data Scientist' Certificate on Coursera that I got (course 9: Capstone Project)

In this project we will tackle one of the problems mentioned in the instructions for the assignment, which is a recommendation system of where to open a new business. If someone is looking to open a business in the city of Toronto, how can we recommend
the best neighborhood to open his business in? The idea is that we want to open a business in a neighborhood where that venue type is least common to maximize profits and avoid competition.

For this problem, we will take as an example an investor who wants to open a fast food
chain in the city of Toronto. We will give at the end our recommendation of where to open the
restaurant, and where not to open it.

## Data Description

The data used for this project came from <a href = 'https://foursquare.com/'>Foursquare</a> and from a <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M'>Wikipedia page</a> containing the list of postal codes for Canada. The Information about the neighborhoods as well as popular venues within them will be obtained using Foursquare API.
